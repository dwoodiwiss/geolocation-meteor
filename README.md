# Geolocation-meteor Demo

A [Meteor](http://meteor.com) app that uses the [HTML5 Geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation/Using_geolocation) to send the users location data to a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) collection, that is then used to display the users location on a [Google Map](https://developers.google.com/maps/).  

This was produced as a quick proof of concept over part of my weekend.  
It allowed me to dig deeper into the [Meteor](http://meteor.com) framework, as well as the [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/) API.
